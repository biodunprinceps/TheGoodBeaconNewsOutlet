✅ AUTOMATIC DATABASE SEEDING CONFIGURED!

🎯 What Was Done:
=================

1. RAILWAY START SCRIPT UPDATED
   - Added: php artisan db:seed --force
   - Added: php create-admin.php (auto-create admin user)
   - Runs on every Railway deployment

2. DATABASE SEEDER MADE IDEMPOTENT
   - Checks if articles exist before seeding
   - Won't create duplicates on re-deployment
   - Safe to run multiple times

3. DEPLOYMENT NOTES CREATED
   - Complete documentation in DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md
   - Explains seeding process for Railway & Docker
   - Troubleshooting guide included
